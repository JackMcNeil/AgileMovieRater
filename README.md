### Comments
- We worked well together in the planning phase and then were able to start to build out the webAPI. Our biggest problems remain to be with github and pulling correctly. 
- When you clone the file are files don't display and you have to go add the exisiting items. Once you had the exisiting items the code builds correctly.
